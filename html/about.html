				<h3>About me</h3>
				<p>I have two main passions. My first is St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Having been diagnosed with biphenotypic leukemia in late 2007 and finished chemo in 2010, I have been volunteering and raising money for St. Jude for over 13 years now. I was a committee chair for the Tampa, Florida St. Jude Walk/Run to End Childhood Cancer which was one of the top walks in the country and raised over $240,000. I love having an opportunity to give back to a hospital that put me into remission and freely shares their research to save children.</p>
				<p>My other main passion is computers, technology, and bionics. I got involved with computers and I now enjoy building computers, writing programs, networking hardware, and acting as the sysadmin for my family. From my interest in computers came my interest in bionics early in high school. I wrote a mini extended essay for my IB program on Hugh Herr – the first man to demonstrate a running gait under neural command. He is an innovative leader in the space and even the new surgical technique for amputation he is pushing is quite novel. From there I became deeply interested in the intersection of computing, engineering, and biology.</p>
				<p>Human engineering is fascinating and still nascent in the directions we can grow. But biostructures have been around for far longer and their complexity in their capability to grow, heal, create energy, store energy, and evolve are truly unique. I cannot wait until it's an archaic phrase to say, “we still don't understand the brain”. Unlocking the ability to modify the brain may prove to be the biggest advancement in healthcare for generations to come. I want to play a part in reverse engineering biology to better integrate human engineering with the natural constructs that are our bodies. Our engineering still triggers foreign body reactions to implanted biomaterials in our bodies, the divide between human engineering and biological engineering has yet to fall.</p>
				<p>I want to use bionics to change the definition of human enablement, to allow humans to become better and stronger at discrete tasks, to increase survivability on harsh worlds allowing for vast opportunities for exploration, and to improve and modify input/output efficiency. I see all technology as a minor evolution in terms of input/output that we as humans can achieve. From handwriting to 115 wpm on a keyboard to being able to transcribe directly from our brains in the future with something like Elon Musk's Neuralink. I am excited by this steady advancement of IO efficiency and what we can do by adding novel components like modern computing into our stream of IO once we understand how to modify the brain.</p>
